In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>',frontmatter:{title:"Hello World",date:"May 01, 2015"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/hello-world/",previous:null,next:{fields:{slug:"/my-second-post/"},frontmatter:{title:"My Second Post!"}}}}}});
